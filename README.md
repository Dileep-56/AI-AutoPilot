# AI AutoPilot

AI Autopilot is an innovative deep learning project that utilizes computer vision techniques to predict accurate steering angles for autonomous vehicles. This repository contains the codebase and model architecture that enables an AI system to autonomously steer a car by analyzing input images captured from a front-facing camera.
